# CMP6090 - Functional Programming University Module Coursework

Bit of a name.

This repo contains practise exercises completed for our functional programming
module at university. It will also contain the main tasks required to pass
the module.

This repo may interest you if you are looking to start learning F# and would
like to see how basic things are done, as it's a learning experience for me too!

## Structure

The exercises are structured in folders as such:

- exercises/
  - week##/
    - exercise##.fs[x]

While the main tasks will have their own named folders in the root.
